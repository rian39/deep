# The 3rd most influential person in London, 2014, works on data, infrastructures, games and brains

After Dennis Osborne (UK Chancellor of the Exchequer), Boris Johnson (Mayor of London), _The Evening Standard_ listed Demis Hassabis as 2014's most influential Londoner <http://www.standard.co.uk/news/the1000/the-1000--londons-most-influential-people-2014-tech-stars-9780818.html>. Hassabis, a computer game designer, neuroscientist, world gaming champion, chess master and artificial intelligence expert had in 2014 started working for the Google Corporation. Google has paid £400 million for DeepMind, the company Hassabis started with two others in 2011. DeepMind has no products, but it had managed to construct neural networks that could play Atari computer games [@Mnih_2013], and it was this game-playing performance that probably motivated Google's purchase, since, as is well known, Google has had a long standing commitment to data mining, machine learning and artificial intelligence in general in their bid to "organise the world's information" <https://www.google.co.uk/about/company/>. Reportedly, Hassabis' DeepMind work at Google is already shaping search engine results [@Levy_2015]. 

This is not an isolated case of the melding of information infrastructures with data mining, pattern recognition or machine learning techniques. We could turn to IBM's Watson, a form of artificial intelligence that first shot to prominence by winning the US TV quiz show 'Jeopardy' in 2011. In the years since, Watson has been networked and re-tooled as a  'cognitive computing' assemblage whose Ecosystem has, with the help of \$1 billion investment and a team of several thousand, rapidly penetrated elite medical institutions such as the Mayo Clinic or the Sloan Kettering Memorial Cancer Institute, and has wedded itself to insurance, education, the health industry, various scientific field (notably genomics) and cooking, amongst other things. The financialised promise of these approaches is also well evidenced in the case of HP Autonomy. Autonomy, one of the UK's largest and most profitable software businesses, was bought by HP for £7.4 billion (\$10 billion) in 2011 on the basis of its Bayesian pattern recognition techniques (also branded as 'meaning-based computing', themselves allied with researchers in computer science at Cambridge). Within months, HP 'wrote down' the value of its acquisition by around \$8 billion, claiming accounting improprieties. Despite these accounting difficulties and ongoing litigation, HP has integrated the key components of 'meaning-based computing' into its many faceted utility, healthcare, transport, call-centre management, data management, operations management, patient records, legal support, security and intelligence products.  

DeepMind, Watson and Autonomy have something in common. They are all polymorphous figures of infrastructural reorganisation. In each case, they take very seriously the relation between humans and infrastructures. The present problems of seeing, hearing, checking and comparing as no longer the province of human operators or workers in given settings, but as matters for an often almost Cyclopean infrastructure to undertake. They are all highly 'mindful,' and abound in references to cognition, meaning, perception, sense data, hearing, speaking, seeing, remembering, deciding, and surprisingly, imagining and fantasy. At the same time, references to hardware and infrastructural specificities abound.  

TBC -- google's way of provisioning infrastructure -- cheap commodity hardware + experimental management
-- the repurposing of GPUs + the revitalisation of neural nets -- these mattered a lot to philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists, but were overtaken by svms
-- the brain, the hippocampus, etc. (cognition, meaning, mind)
-- the atari games, and the example of deepmind playing pong in a way that exploits the systems weakness: one system finds something in another system - is this an infrastructural icon ... 
-- resurrection of AI will mean what? lots of work for philosophers, sociologists and anthropologists trying to understand what happens to Theo in _Her_?0
- Google already had Ng, Thrun, Hinton and the Ray Kurzweil ...
